 <h1>css3-color Conformance Test Suite</h1>

 <p>This is a development version of the css3-color Conformance Test Suite.</p>

 <p>Basic tests have been written for most sections of the specification, but
   more tests are welcome.  Improvements to existing tests for precision
   or ease of testing are also welcome.
   There are no tests for some sections that have no known implementations.
   Tests have not yet been verified as correct.  Please
   check the latest version of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color">css3-color
   specification</a> before assuming a failure is due to an implementation
   bug and not a test suite bug.</p>

 <p>In time we hope to correct all errors and extend this test suite to
  cover all of css3-color. Your help is welcome in this effort. The appropriate
  mailing list for submitting tests, bug reports, and other comments is
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>.
  More information on the contribution process and test guidelines is
  available on the <a href="http://csswg.inkedblade.net/test/css2.1">wiki
  page</a> for the CSS2.1 test suite, which follows the same format.</p>

 <p>Tests are currently available in three formats:</p>

 <dl>
   <dt><a href="xhtml1/">XHTML 1.1</a></dt>
     <dd>XHTML 1.1 tests sent as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code></dd>
   <dt><a href="html4/">HTML 4.01</a></dt>
     <dd>HTML 4.01 tests sent as <code>text/html</code></dd>
   <dt><a href="xhtml1print/">XHTML 1.1 for Printers</a></dt>
     <dd>XHTML 1.1 tests with any images converted from PNG to JPEG
       and formatted with headers and footers to ease testing of
       embedded printer software.</dd>
  </dl>

 <p>A collection of <a href="reports/">implementation reports</a> is
 available, including a
 <a href="reports/implementation-report-TEMPLATE.html">template</a> for
 creating new reports.</p>
