Suggested tests to write for CSS Fonts at Test the Web Forward Tokyo:

Getting started:

Try writing a very simple test using the test harness, just to get used to the infrastructure.

Simple tests:

Test parsing of the @font-face rule (chapter 4). Try various combinations of descriptors, and get them using JavaScript. (E. g. using document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].cssText).

Moderate tests:

Look in https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/tree/master/layout/reftests/ and https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/tree/master/layout/style/test (search for "font") for Mozilla tests that can be converted to W3C tests to check the spec.

Difficult tests:

Chapter 6-7 about Font Features. If you're interested, ask Experts for help!

Notes:

In Mozilla's repository, layout/style/test/property_database.js has a property reference you can use instead of reading the spec.
