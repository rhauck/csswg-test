W3C CSS Test Suite Repository
-----------------------------
 
This repository contains top level directories for all of CSS specs for
which we currently have tests. If you are writing tests for a spec and it
doesn't yet have a directory here, feel free to create it.

There are a few directories that do not map to specifications:

support/ contains common image files to which many of the tests link in
this location

tools/ is random scripts that may be useful when administering tests.

vendor-imports/ is where third parties may import their tests that originate
and are maintained in an external repo. Files in this directory should
never be modified in this repo, but should go through the vendor's process
to be imported here.

work-in-progress/ is a legacy directory that contains all the work that was
once submitted to the repo, but was not yet ready for review. Since the CSSWG
has adopted the GitHub pull request process, no new files should be landed here.
The subdirectories here are named by test author or contributing organization.
 
Contributing
-------------

Absolutely everyone is welcome (and even encouraged) to contribute to test
development, so long as you fulfill the contribution requirements detailed
in the [Contributing Guidelines][contributing]. No test is too small or too
simple, especially if it corresponds to something for which you've noted an
interoperability bug in a browser.

Write Access
------------

This section only applies if you have cloned the repository from
Mercurial. If you've cloned it from GitHub, which is a mirror of
the canonical Mercurial repo, you can submit your tests via a [pull request][github101].

To gain write access to this Mercurial repository, sign up for an account
on the CSS Test Suite Manager (aka Shepherd) at:
https://test.csswg.org/shepherd/register
and then submit a request on the Repository Access page at:
https://test.csswg.org/shepherd/account/access/

You will be notified by email when your request is processed.

Please note that although we will grant write access directly to the Mercurial
repo, it is strongly advised to use GitHub for test submissions to enable
reviewers to use its built-in review tools. Direct submissions to Mercurial
should be limited to administrative or housekeeping tasks, very minor changes
that don't require a review, or from advanced users of the system.
